# Code Structure and Best practices

Celsius app project is divided into the following sections:
- `/components`   
- `/constants`   
- `/context`   
- `/mock-data`   
- `/navigator`   
- `/redux`   
- `/services`   
- `/utils`

## Components (/components)

A folder containing all React Native components used in the app.
Components are separated into different folders based on the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles.
Following types of components exist in the app:
- `atoms` - Smallest components used throughout the app, think of them as basic Bootstrap components
- `molecules` - More complex components used throughout the app, think of them as complex Bootstrap components
- `organisms` - Celsius specific and custom components (sections, tables, modals...) 
- `graphs` - All components related to graphs
- `layouts` - Layouts wrapping screens (eg. `AuthLayout`)
- `screens` - Screens in the app
 
### 💚 DO:
- run `yarn plop Component` to create all needed component files
- run `yarn plop Screen` to create all needed screen files
### ❌ DON'T:  
- call services from components

## Services (/services)
Services are the only way of communicating with the server or with third party services.

### 💚 DO:
- run `yarn plop Service` to create service file
- make methods extremely stupid oneliners

- put `axios` calls anywhere else
- map or format data in services

### ❓ DO IF YOU MUST:
### ❗ TO BE DISCUSSED:
